# **Hailuo AI Subject Reference Model Tutorial**

**Hailuo AI’s Subject Reference Model** enables the recognition of facial features from photos uploaded by users. It can then generate a character with corresponding facial traits and create video scenes featuring that character based on text prompts.

**Subject Reference Model Tutorial**

To generate videos using Hailuo AI’s Subject Reference Model, users must provide two key inputs:

- **Subject's Facial Photo**
- **Prompt for Video Generation**
1. **The first step is to click "Try Now" to enter the creation page.**

**Subject's Facial Photo**
The Subject Reference Model requires a clear, recognizable photo of the subject’s face to serve as a reference for generating the character's face in the video. Currently, the model only supports facial recognition for human faces.

Hailuo AI is capable of accurately identifying facial features across various genders, ages, and ethnicities. To achieve optimal video generation results, ensure that the uploaded image meets the necessary specifications, including proper angles and lighting conditions.

### **Specifications**

**Face Count**: The Subject Reference Model only supports uploading single-person photos for facial recognition.

**Image Size**: Resolution should be no lower than 120x120, and the image file should not exceed 20MB.

**Other Requirements**: The face must not be obstructed, and the photo should not be out of focus or contain excessive filters or special effects.

**Standard Facial Photo：**

### **Subject angle**

The subject angle in the uploaded photo should be either **directly facing the camera** or **slightly turned to the side**.

- **Directly facing the camera**: The subject's face should be directly facing the camera, with clear facial features visible in the frame, providing the most complete facial information.
- **Slightly turned to the side**: The subject's facial features and facial contours should still be fully visible in the photo, **avoiding profiles or angles where the facial features are not within the frame**.

## Prompt for Video Generation

The generation logic of the Subject Reference Model is similar to that of text-to-video generation. For more details, please refer to the Text-to-Video Prompt tutorial.

The prompt used for the Subject Reference Model should focus on **a single subject** to achieve the most accurate results.

If the prompt involves multiple subjects, additional descriptions of the specific subjects can be included. Hailuo AI can identify the corresponding facial features based on **age and gende**r and generate the appropriate subject accordingly.

### How to accurately execute prompts with multiple subjects？

1. Adding gender information of the face in the **promp**t can help Hailuo AI lock onto the correct subject and generate the expected scene.

# **Hailuo AI Text to Video Tutorial**

## Getting Started : What is Prompt

Prompt is the key to the world of generated AI, constructed from your inspiration and creativity.

Whether you are a newcomer to AI or a veteran who is already proficient in using AI to empower productivity, you can easily master the skills of writing prompts through a clear structure and a flexible way of expression.  The vision of “one person + one AI = one professional crew” is right around the corner.

To improve the quality of video results, we have developed two Prompt formulas of your use:

### **1. Basic Prompt Formula**

Basic Prompt Formula is designed for those who are uncertain about the exact videos they wish to create, or those who seek to use Hailuo AI as a source of inspiration. This type of prompt will offer you a range of more incentive visual ideas.

**❤️Basic Prompt Formula**= **Main Subject + Scene + Motion**

**Main Subject:** This core message of the video can be a person, an animal, another object or an imaginary object that does not exist.

**Scene：**The scene describes the environmental information of the video, etc a library, a coffee shop ...... or even a fantastical fictional space.

**Motion:** Motion is the description of the main object's moving status in the video, such as stillness, movement; the transformation of the environment and space, and so on.

> Example
> 
> 
> A puppy runs in the park.
> 
> A woman with an umbrella walks down a rainy street.
> 
> A small stream flows quietly in a valley.
> 

### **2. Precise Prompt Formula**

The Prompt Precision Formula is designed for users requiring advanced camera movement or image presentation, aiming for a more professional-grade video production.  Precise and detailed prompts can enhance the visual quality of the footage.

Precise Prompt Formula = **Main Subject** + **Scene** + **Motion** + **Camera Movement** + **Aesthetic Atmosphere**

**Camera Movement:** You can use common camera movements, such as tracking, zooming, panning, handheld and other camera movements to restrict the final presentation.

**Aesthetic Atmosphere**: You can describe the visual style and the sense of atmosphere to get a better result.

> For Example：
> 
> 
> A couple sit on a park bench communicating. The camera maintains a fixed shot of the couple. The color tone of the picture is warm, the atmosphere is cozy.
> 
> A lamb is grazing in a meadow. The camera slowly pushes forward the lamb. The color tone of the picture is natural and realistic.
> 
> A man in a suit eats noodles in a noodle shop. The camera gradually pulls away to show the noisy environment of the noodle shop. The picture has a natural color tone.
> 

### 3. Tips for using Prompt Formulas

There's no right or wrong to write a prompt. But overall, prompt writing follows 2 main basic principles:

- The more precise the expression is, the more accurate the result will be.
- The richer the expression gets, the better the overall effect will be.

## Intermediate: How to achieve top performance

### Precise Camera movement

Hailuo AI is adept at responding effectively to various camera movements. It can provide professional video users with well-defined video footage.

- **Add detailed orders to the camera movement**

> For example, “Lens rotating down” can be optimized as :
> 
> 
> “The camera descends slowly and then wraps around to the right as it descends.”
> 
- **Add detailed descriptions to the change made with camera movement**

> For example, “The camera shoots the giraffe from the bottom up” could be optimized as:
> 
> 
> “The camera starts with a close-up of the giraffe's feet, slowly rising to capture the giraffe's body, and finally stops at the giraffe's face, showing giraffe's facial expression in close-up.”
> 
- **Limit the length of the camera movement to a reasonable 5-6 seconds:** avoid overly complex shots that can lead to generation failures

The following example shows the result of adding 【precise camera movement】and 【detailed changes in the frame】in the prompt.

**Example:** The green highlight** is the output responding to the change of the prompt**

**Prompt 1**

The camera begins with an overhead shot of a mysterious forest clearing, with a female warrior in armor standing alone in the center of the clearing. Her armor shimmers with a cold silver light in the moonlight, and the trees around her cast dappled shadows. The camera begins to slowly descend and hover around her, as the perspective changes, the longsword in her hand can be seen trembling slightly, with undried blood remaining on the blade, the camera continues to wrap around, sliding from side to side, gradually drawing in closer to capture the side of her determined face. Her slightly clenched lower lip could be seen, and a few loose strands of hair on her face were soaked in sweat and plastered to her forehead. As the camera circled around to her front, the image became tighter, the focus gradually coming to rest on her face. By now, the forest in the background has blurred into a dark shadow. The camera eventually stops at a close-up of her front, focusing on her sharp eyes. The moonlight hits her face, outlining every detail of her face.

**Prompt 2**

The camera looks down on a moonlit forest clearing. The camera rotates around a female warrior in silver armor holding a longsword, after which the camera drops down to capture the side of the female warrior, who has blood on her longsword. The camera continues to circle, sliding past the side and gradually pulling in closer to capture the side of the warrior woman's face, after which the camera wraps around to her front, with the focus gradually settling on a close-up of her face.

In a dimly lit room, a young boy is captured in close-up, his eyes glued to the glowing screen of a game console. The camera is slightly above the horizon, focusing on his concentrated expression as his fingers deftly manipulate the controller. Suddenly, the mood changes as the figure of a game character suddenly appears and breaks through the screen. The camera has a shallow depth of field and pans smoothly between the boy and the now three-dimensional figure, blurring the edges of the console and the wall behind it, which is plastered with posters for various games. The boy interacts with the character in surprise, his movements reflecting the excitement and disbelief of the moment. The characters are vivid and detailed, jumping and dancing around the room and playing with the boy. The camera captures the fantastical scene with dynamic angles and fluid movements, enhancing the sense of wonder and movement through a skillful combination of slow motion and fast editing. Subtle changes in lighting enhance the realism of the characters' movements, with shadows and highlights interplaying on the boy and the characters.

# **Hailuo AI Image to Video Tutorial**

## **Image to Video Tutorial**

### **1. I2V Basic Prompt Formula**

The image used in image-to-video generation appears as the first frame of the video, defining the subject's appearance and the basic aesthetic style of the video. Therefore, compared to text-to-video prompts, image-to-video prompts can appropriately reduce the amount of information.

✅ Basic Prompt Formula=Main Subject in the first frame + Motion/Change

Main Subject in the first frame：The objects in the scene, including key details and environmental information, are precisely recognized by Hailuo AI, which can identify characters, objects, and other visual elements in the image and generate videos based on the prompt requirements.

Motion/ Change：Motion is the description of the main object's moving status in the video, such as stillness, movement; the transformation of the environment and space, and so on.

**Prompt 26**

A blue furry creature in the scene is constantly stirring a steaming pot of soup. Then, the blue creature blows on the pot, causing the soup in the bowl in front of it to freeze into a block of ice.

### **2. I2V Precise Prompt Formula**

Adding camera details and atmosphere information to the basic formula allows for more precise control over the video, resulting in more dynamic or distinctly stylized outputs.

✅  Precise Prompt Formula= Main Subject in the first frame + Motion/Change +Camera Movement + Aesthetic Atmosphere

Camera Movement：Image-to-video generation can also precisely control camera movements. Using the information in the image as a reference in the prompt can lead to more accurate results.

Aesthetic Atmosphere：Although the first frame establishes the visual tone and atmosphere of the video's beginning, Hailuo AI's image-to-video generation can still adjust the visual aesthetics and mood to produce content that better aligns with expectations.

**Case 40** — "Sci-Fi Trailer"

Traditional sci-fi imagery features similar visual elements. By creating empty shots with these common visual elements, we can produce scenes with similar settings and aesthetic styles. Using high-quality shots such as "explosions" as key rhythm points, a tense and thrilling sci-fi movie teaser is created.

**Case 41** —— "Avalanche Disaster Movie Trailer"

Based on the theme of "avalanche," multiple sets of **empty shots and large-scale scene**

combinations are designed to make the most of Hailuo AI's outstanding performance in text-to-video generation. Through rhythmically strong editing, a teaser is created with a simple storyline that ties the shots together.

### **2 Specially-Used Cases：Montage with Similar Objects**

Based on Hailuo AI's rich scene realism capabilities, in fast-paced montage scenes, similar prompts can be used to generate a variety of scenes with similar compositions, allowing for seamless transitions. This maximizes the avoidance of subject stability issues without affecting the narrative structure.

**Montage with Similar Objects** — "The Sci-Fi Portal Across Time and Space"

**Generated Video 42**

[42.mp4](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d711daf0-52ab-49a9-86d5-843ab6403d79/4aa376ae-21b8-4baa-b422-80d78e6e9e17/42.mp4)

The similar "sci-fi portal" image is generated in different time and space settings, with the shots quickly assembled together, creating a highly dynamic response to the narrative structure of crossing time and space.

### **PS：Ways to Improve Subject Stability**

Based on Hailuo AI's high-quality prompt response capabilities, text-to-video can be used to maintain specific shape consistency.

By testing the consistency of shape description prompts, stable visual elements are identified, and these are repeatedly used to maintain a certain level of stability.

✅Subject Elements — **Hairstyle + Age/Gender + Clothing Color + Environment**

**Hairstyle/Clothing:** These elements stabilize the character's head image.

**Age:** Generates characters of a similar age.

**Environment:** The same environmental space, especially lighting, helps enhance the audience's "consistency" perception of the character's image.

For example, in environments with high contrast between light and shadow, retaining minimal facial details of the character helps maintain "**consistency**" in their appearance.

## **Image-to-video Cases for Practical Application**

**I2V Advantages：**Precise control of the visual subject; precise control of the visual aesthetics.

**I2V Disadvantages：**The initial workload is relatively large; the margin for error in creation is low; creative freedom is relatively limited.

### **1 Mainly-Used Cases**

Image-to-video ensures the stability of the video's subject information, making it suitable for narratives with fixed subjects. It allows for the continuation of video segments from static frames, completing the narrative function.

**Examples: The segment is excerpted from the HailuoAI promotional video "Magic Wheel."**

Using a set of images with the same subject, a video is generated to meet the narrative requirements, ensuring consistency of the subject's appearance in the story's visuals. *(The video sound is post-production.)*

**Plot 47**

The little evil dragon police officer feels nervous about the world spiraling out of control but still tries to maintain composure.

### **2 Specially-Used Cases：Using the last frame to create long shot**

Currently, Hailuo AI can generate 6 seconds of high-quality video, but it is possible to reasonably use the last frame of an existing video as the first frame for text-to-video output, allowing for the continuation and creation of pseudo-long shots that exceed 6 seconds.*(The video sound is post-production.)*

**Example: The segment is excerpted from the HailuoAI promotional video "Magic Wheel."**

**Generated Video 48**

[48.mp4](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d711daf0-52ab-49a9-86d5-843ab6403d79/0ad887a9-26cf-43a8-8bf5-b9f5087c92e8/48.mp4)

**Step 1**

First, generate the basic action required for the video — the girl raises her hand to touch the Magic Wheel and then lowers her arm.

**Step 2**

Capture the last frame of the video with the desired effect (see below), and use this final frame as an image for the second text-to-video generation — the camera slowly pulls back, capturing the Magic Wheel as it begins to glow and rotate after being touched by the girl.

**Step 4**

Combine the three segments of video editing as described above to obtain a complete 11-second video, showcasing the full action of the girl touching the Magic Wheel, causing its magic to fail.

### **3 Specially-Used Cases： Image composition and seamless blending across transitions**

By combining any two images with an appropriate ratio and then creating an image-to-video, Hailuo AI can seamlessly blend the characters from one image into the other. Once the subject transitions from the original scene to the target scene, the lighting, shadows, and color tones will perfectly match the new scene’s setting. This offers infinite possibilities for deterministic creation in a wide range of high-quality scenarios.

## **Comprehensive Application Case**

**T2V / I2V Comprehensive Application**

- Use text-to-video for scenes or shots that do not require subject stability.
- Use image-to-video for shots that require precise and stable subject appearance.

Example:**Hailuo AI's Halloween-Themed film *(Video sound is post-production).***

**Shot1: Generated Video 55**

[55.mp4](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d711daf0-52ab-49a9-86d5-843ab6403d79/493c1b25-4c39-4bb6-a9c3-e464698b6e3c/55.mp4)

**Plot**

Show a chubby man in a green outfit enjoying himself indoors during Halloween, interrupted by a knock on the door.

**Tutorial**

As the first shot of the opening scene, use text-to-video for production. By specifying detailed subject characteristics — **middle-aged, black long hair, green shirt, black glasses, and overweight** — establish a solid foundation for subject description in the subsequent video generation.

**Plot**

Indicate that the knocking sound is coming from outside the door.

**Tutorial**

Immediately follow the man's head-turning motion with a point-of-view shot from his perspective, revealing the source of the knocking sound. This is an empty shot with no subject, created using text-to-video, slowly pushing in on a white door.

**Plot**

The man scolds and tells the person outside the door to go away.

**Tutorial**

Use a close-up of the man to advance the plot. Since it’s a close-up, only some of the man's features need to be shown. Text-to-video will be used to generate and maintain the subject's description — **black hair, overweight, glasses, green shirt…** ensuring the stability of the subject's appearance.

**Plot**

The man reluctantly gets up to open the door.

**Tutorial**

The man needs to transition from his initial state in the first scene to the action of getting up to open the door. The consistency of the subject is crucial here, and it needs to be done under the same scene and lighting conditions. Image-to-video will be used to continue from the last frame of the first shot to ensure the subject's appearance remains stable.

**Plot**

The man rejects the girls' request for candy with a look of disdain.

**Tutorial**

Here, a over-the-shoulder shot is needed to establish the spatial relationship between the girls and the man, while also showcasing the man’s detailed facial expression. Use text-to-video to generate the scene, selecting the shot and subject expressions that best fit the needs for the final footage.
