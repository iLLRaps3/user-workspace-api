## [Groq API Reference](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference\#groq-api-reference)

[**Chat**](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat)

[**Create chat completion**](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

POSThttps://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

### [**Request Body**](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference\#chat-create-request-body)

- messagesarrayRequired



A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.







### Show possible types

- modelstringRequired



ID of the model to use. For details on which models are compatible with the Chat API, see available [models](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)

- exclude\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional



Deprecated: Use search\_settings.exclude\_domains instead.
A list of domains to exclude from the search results when the model uses a web search tool.

- frequency\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0



Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

- function\_callDeprecatedstring / object or nullOptional



Deprecated in favor of `tool_choice`.



Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.
`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.
Specifying a particular function via `{"name": "my_function"}` forces the model to call that function.



`none` is the default when no functions are present. `auto` is the default if functions are present.







### Show possible types

- functionsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional



Deprecated in favor of `tools`.



A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.







### Show properties

- include\_domainsDeprecatedarray or nullOptional



Deprecated: Use search\_settings.include\_domains instead.
A list of domains to include in the search results when the model uses a web search tool.

- logit\_biasobject or nullOptional



This is not yet supported by any of our models.
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

- logprobsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false



This is not yet supported by any of our models.
Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the `content` of `message`.

- max\_completion\_tokensinteger or nullOptional



The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

- max\_tokensDeprecatedinteger or nullOptional



Deprecated in favor of `max_completion_tokens`.
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

- metadataobject or nullOptional



This parameter is not currently supported.

- ninteger or nullOptionalDefaults to 1



How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.

- parallel\_tool\_callsboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to true



Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

- presence\_penaltynumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 0



Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

- reasoning\_formatstring or nullOptional



Specifies how to output reasoning tokens

- response\_formatobject / object / object or nullOptional



An object specifying the format that the model must output. Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. json\_schema response format is only supported on llama 4 models. Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using `json_schema` is preferred for models that support it.







### Show possible types

- search\_settingsobject or nullOptional



Settings for web search functionality when the model uses a web search tool.







### Show properties

- seedinteger or nullOptional



If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.
Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

- service\_tierstring or nullOptional



The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to `on_demand`.



- `auto` will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.
- `flex` uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.

- stopstring / array or nullOptional



Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.







### Show possible types

- storeboolean or nullOptional



This parameter is not currently supported.

- streamboolean or nullOptionalDefaults to false



If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message. [Example code](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat#streaming-a-chat-completion).

- stream\_optionsobject or nullOptional



Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set `stream: true`.







### Show properties

- temperaturenumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1



What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top\_p but not both.

- tool\_choicestring / object or nullOptional



Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
`none` means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message.
`auto` means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools.
`required` means the model must call one or more tools.
Specifying a particular tool via `{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that tool.



`none` is the default when no tools are present. `auto` is the default if tools are present.







### Show possible types

- toolsarray or nullOptional



A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.







### Show properties

- top\_logprobsinteger or nullOptional



This is not yet supported by any of our models.
An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to `true` if this parameter is used.

- top\_pnumber or nullOptionalDefaults to 1



An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top\_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

- userstring or nullOptional



A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help us monitor and detect abuse.


### [**Returns**](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference\#chat-create-returns)

Returns a [chat completion](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create) object, or a streamed sequence of [chat completion chunk](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create) objects if the request is streamed.

- filestringOptional



The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.
Either a file or a URL must be provided. Note that the file field is not supported in Batch API requests.

- timestamp\_granularities\[\]arrayOptionalDefaults to segment



The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: `word`, or `segment`. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

- urlstringOptional



The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL).
