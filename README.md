# User Workspace

## Project Overview
User Workspace is a modern web application leveraging the Vercel platform for serverless functions and TypeScript for enhanced type safety. It provides an API for user authentication and interaction with a user database. This application aims to streamline user management and improve overall user experience in web applications.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To run the application locally, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`, allowing you to access the API endpoints and implement user management features.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **API Integration**: Easily integrate with other front-end frameworks or applications.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes Vercel for deploying serverless functions for optimal scalability.
- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies (as specified in `package.json`):

- **tsx**: ^4.19.4
- **vercel**: ^42.3.0

Additionally, there are various supporting libraries included in the `package-lock.json` for enhanced functionalities.

## Project Structure
The project is organized in the following structure:

```
user-workspace/
|-- api/                      # Directory for API endpoints
|   |-- index.ts              # Main API entry point
|   |-- auth/                 # Authentication related APIs
|       |-- user.ts           # User-related authentication functions
|-- package.json              # npm package configurations
|-- package-lock.json         # Exact versions of installed packages
|-- README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during execution, check the following:
- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
- Review the Vercel deployment configurations.
- Refer to the logs (`logs_result.json`) for error messages and stack traces.
